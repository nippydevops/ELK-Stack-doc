Few points to remember about elasticsearch
Port 9300 to talk to other port in elasticsearch

it increases throghput same search on same data.
cluster
nodes
shards    index
documents 


Green : all primary and replica shards allocated



yellow: all primary shards allocated 
one or more replica are unallocated.


RED: one or more primary shards unallocated.


Node type 
Master eligible.
  creating/deleting index
  tracking cluster members
   shards allocation

Data 
CRUD operation 
contains shard

Ingest :pipeline basic

Co-ordinating-only Node
  Routes requests
  handles searcg reducing
  Distributes bulk indexing.

Machine Learning node



Cluster Creation



tomorrow
Cluster Name is given
Step 1 - swapoff is needed.
node.name: master
node.master: true
node.data:false
data and log path
repo path needs to be managed as well.





node1    master 


node2   data+master
node2   Data

_local_
_site_

How to check cluster status :
http://192.168.0.108:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true
_cluster/state
_cluster/pending_tasks
_nodes/stats

_cat/nodes



cluster status
curl -XGET http://192.168.0.110:9200/_cluster/health?pretty


Shards status :
http://192.168.0.110:9200/_cat/shards?v

recovry shards:
curl -XGET http://192.168.0.108:9200/_cat/shards | grep UNASSIGNED | awk '{print $2}



userful script:
for shard in $(curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards | grep UNASSIGNED | awk '{print $2}'); do
    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_cluster/reroute' -d '{
        "commands" : [ {
              "allocate" : {
                  "index" : "t37", 
                  "shard" : $shard, 
                  "node" : "datanode15", 
                  "allow_primary" : true
              }
            }
        ]
    }'
    sleep 5
done
